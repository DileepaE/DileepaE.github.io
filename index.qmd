I am a specialist researcher in spatiotemporal disease mapping, dedicated to addressing the health challenges of marginalized populations. I leverage model-based geostatistics to translate complex epidemiological data into high-resolution evidence for global policy and precision resource allocation. 

As a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) with over a decade of teaching practice, I am committed to developing quantitative literacy among undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, mentoring the next generation of researchers, and designing specialist professional training for health practitioners and policymakers.
